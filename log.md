# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 29 2022, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've continued Udemy course called "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele. I've finished a section on the basics of Mongoose, learned about mongoose validations, instance and static model methods. Also, I now know about virtual properties and middleware in mongoose.

**Thoughts:** I am very happy that I found out about this challenge, because I really need that sort of pressure to study more.
